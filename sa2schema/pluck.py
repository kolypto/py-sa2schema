""" Tools to help plucking SqlAlchemy instances

Plucking is normally done by Pydantic.BaseModel.from_orm(), but it needs some help.
Without our assistance, it would get every attribute it can.
This may include @property attributes that will in turn trigger the loading of other nested attributes.

To help with this, "plucking map" dictionaries are used, which look like this:

    {'id': 1, 'name': 1, 'property': 1, 'relationship': { 'attribute': 1 }}

Those dictionaries explicitly specify which attributes to load:

* `1` to load, `0` to skip
* nested dictionary to specify attributes for a relationship
* use `1` for a relationship to pluck loaded attributes only
